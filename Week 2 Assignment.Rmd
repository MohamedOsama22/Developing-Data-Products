# Instructions:      
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.   
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.     
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.      
We would love to see you show off your creativity

```{r}


library(leaflet)

my_map<-leaflet() %>%  addTiles()

my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=38.8976771, lng=-77.0367341,popup="POTUS' Office")

WHIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://goo.gl/maps/DdjV3X5pzJ12",
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)

photoLink<-"<a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DdjV3X5pzJ12'>White House photo </a>"
website<- "<a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/'>The White House </a>"

my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=38.8976771, lng=-77.0367341,popup=photoLink)  %>% addPopups(lat=38.8976771, lng=-77.0367341, popup=photoLink,popupOptions(keepInView = T))
